## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing the data, building a regression model, evaluating its performance, and creating insightful visualizations.

## Data Preprocessing

The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables. Date-based features are engineered, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets.

## Model Development

A neural network model is developed using TensorFlow and Keras to predict COVID-19 confirmed cases based on various features.

## Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) to assess its predictive accuracy.

## Data Visualizations

Several types of visualizations are generated, including training and validation loss plots, actual vs. predicted confirmed cases scatter plots, and bar graphs showcasing the top countries with the most confirmed cases.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn`.
3. Place the `full_grouped.csv` dataset in the same directory.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis.
